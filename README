# Maze solver

This is my work on a maze solution simulator as part of the [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) curriculum.
I am hoping to extend this project to use different pathfinding routines,
possibly including my Dijkstra algorithm from the 2024 Advent of Code.
This will be difficult due to the fundamental differences in how the mazes are defined.
