# Maze solver

This is my work on a maze solution simulator as part of the [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) curriculum.
It currently uses tkinter to visualize a grid and generate the maze before solving it via a depth-first search.
I am hoping to extend this project to use different pathfinding routines, such as A* and
possibly including my Dijkstra algorithm from the 2024 Advent of Code.
This will be difficult due to the fundamental differences in how the mazes are defined.
